Currently, only the unit tests have been numbered and renamed.
To ensure overall consistency and for subsequent regression testing, some work remains to be done

TODOs:
    1. Standardize the style of all test files: overview, usage,...
    2. Support reading command-line arguments
    3. Merge the function-related tests
    4. Add tests to Cmake file
