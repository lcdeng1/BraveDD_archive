Binary, reduction and value on edge, Decision Diagram library.

This is a C++ implementation of various forms of Binary Decision Diagrams
to encode functions over binary variables with various ranges,
various (including dynamic) reduction rules, possibly with edge values,
swap flags, and complement flags.
This supports the following types of BDDs:
    - Byrant's fully-reduced BDDs (standard BDDs)
    - Zero suppressed BDDs
    - Edge valued BDDs
    - ESR, CESR, and RexBDDs
